## **Overview of Project**

### **Kickstarter Analysis for Louise's Theater Project**

This project further explores data taken from kickstarter.  It is an attempt to explore possible relationships between  theater campaigns'launch date' and 'goal amount' with their outcomes (sucsess/failiure). It will vilualize these relationships with line charts.

## **Analysis and Challenges**


### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
From the data provided we are able to compare outcomes of campaigns(success, failiure, cancellation) to launch dates.
The relationship is visualized in the line chart .....

![Fake Title](Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

At a glance we can see that May is the best time to launch. Campaigns launched in at the beginning of summer have the highest sucess rate with May being the peak with 111 success' to 52 failiure.  
December is the worst time to launch.  We can see that theater kickstarters launched in December are the least successful, 37 success' to 35 failiures. Perhaps, donors have to many other expenses around the holiday period. 

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**
In order to examine the relationship between goals and outcome, we have created 12 new catergories for goal amounts. Then, looking at the subcategory "plays" found the outcome totals for each of these new catergories.
We have then calculated the percentages of Success and Failiure for each of our new Goal catergories. We can see the vast majority of campaigns set goals less than $10k and $1k-$5k was the most common goal. 
The results are visualized in the line chart.

We can see that for "Plays" more modest  kickstarters are the most successful. Percentage success rate is highest for campaigns of less than $1000 and remains high for campaigns under $5000.
Goals set at $45,000 and above are least successful and success rate remains poor for higher goals.  It may be that the backers can not accept a cost this high for crowd funded drama.  
  
### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

## **Results**

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

May is the best time to launch. Campaigns launched at the beginning of summer have the highest sucess rate with May being the peak with 111 success' to 52 failiure.   
December is the worst time to launch.  We can see that theater kickstarters launched in December are the least successful, 37 success' to 35 failiures. Perhaps, donors have to many other expenses around the holiday period. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
More modest play based kickstarters are the most successful and most common. Percentage success rate is highest for campaigns of less than $1000 and remains high for campaigns under $5000.
Goals set at $45,000 and above are least successful and success rate remains poor for higher goals. Higher goals are also less common.  It may be that the backers can not accept a cost this high for crowd funded drama.  
  


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The lack of campaigns with high goals limits this dataset. We have only one campaign in the $45-50k, three in $40-45 etc. Most Play kickstarters set a goal of less than $10k.   


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A box and whisker graph could be created to show us the amounts requested for campaigns, allowing us to see the median, IQR and spot outliers.
